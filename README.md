How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?

## Illustrations
In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s) of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to include a few screenshots of your application.
